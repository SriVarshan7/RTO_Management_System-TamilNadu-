Driving License Management System
Project Overview
The Driving License Management System is a web-based application aimed at streamlining the operations of Regional Transport Offices (RTOs). It enables citizens to apply for learner's licenses, driving licenses, and vehicle registrations online, minimizing the need for in-person visits and paperwork. The system provides real-time application tracking, complaint submission, and automated notifications for renewals, thus improving efficiency and user experience.

Features
Learner's License (LLR) Application: Citizens can apply for LLR by entering their Aadhaar number and selecting their desired Category of Vehicle (COV).
Driving License (DL) Application: Once the LLR is approved, users can apply for a driving license after a mandatory wait period.
Vehicle Registration: Enables citizens to register new vehicles, with appointment scheduling for document verification.
Application Status Check: Users can track their LLR, DL, and vehicle registration status.
Complaint Submission: Citizens can submit complaints directly through the system.
Admin and Inspector Modules: RTO officials can update application statuses and send notifications.
Technologies Used
Frontend
HTML: Used for structuring web pages.
CSS (Bootstrap): Ensures a responsive, mobile-friendly design.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic updates to the site.
Backend
PHP: Server-side scripting for dynamic content, session management, and database interactions.
MySQL: Manages data related to user registrations, vehicle details, and license information.
XAMPP: Used for local development, with Apache as the web server and MySQL for backend processing.
Database Structure
The database includes tables such as:

citizen: Contains Aadhaar-based citizen information.
llr: Manages details of learner's license applications.
dl: Stores data related to driving licenses.
reg: Holds vehicle registration details.
Refer to the dbms_p1.sql file for the SQL database schema.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
XAMPP: Install XAMPP to set up an Apache and MySQL server for local development.
Git: Make sure Git is installed to clone the repository.
Cloning the Repository
Open a terminal and navigate to your desired directory.
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone <repository-url>
Move the cloned project folder to XAMPP's htdocs directory:
bash

mv <project-folder> /xampp/htdocs/
Running the Project Locally
Open XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Create a new database (e.g., rto_management).
Import the database schema:
Go to Import tab in phpmyadmin.
Choose the dbms_p1.sql file and import it to set up tables and initial data.
Access the project by opening a browser and going to http://localhost/<project-folder-name>.
Deployment
For deploying the system to production, platforms like Netlify are recommended for hosting the frontend and PHP-compatible hosting for the backend.

Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements include:

Integration with Aadhaar Authentication API
Development of a mobile app version
Online payment support for application fees
AI-driven query and complaint resolution with chatbots
